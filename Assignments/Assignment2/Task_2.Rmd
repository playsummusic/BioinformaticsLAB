# Microbiome (Taxonomic) Analysis
## Installing Required Packages (if not already installed):

```{r install_packages, eval=FALSE}
packages <- c("TreeSummarizedExperiment", "scater", "mia", "miaViz", 
              "patchwork", "vegan", "ggplot2", "tidyverse", "miaQIIME2", 
              "ape", "phangorn", "msa", "bluster", "devtools")

for (pkg in packages) {
  if (!requireNamespace(pkg, quietly = TRUE)) {
    if (pkg %in% c("TreeSummarizedExperiment", "scater", "mia", "miaViz", "miaQIIME2", "devtools")) {
      if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
        install.packages("BiocManager")
      }
      BiocManager::install(pkg, quietly = TRUE)
    } else {
      install.packages(pkg, quietly = TRUE)
    }
  }
}

devtools::install_github("jbisanz/qiime2R")
```


## Then load the required packages:
```{r load_libraries, eval=FALSE}
library(scater)
library(mia)
library(miaViz)
library(patchwork)
library(vegan)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(qiime2R)
library(msa)
```


## First we import our data and have a look at it:
The data is taken from the TUGraz TeachCenter Course: Laboratory Course Bioninformatics/Metagenomics
```{r}
featureTableFile <- "data2/table.qza"
taxonomyTableFile <- "data2/taxonomy.qza"
sampleMetaFile <- "data2/metadata.tsv"
phyTreeFile <- "data2/16s_rooted_tree.qza"

tse <- importQIIME2(
  featureTableFile = featureTableFile,
  taxonomyTableFile = taxonomyTableFile,
  sampleMetaFile = sampleMetaFile,
  phyTreeFile = phyTreeFile
)

tse
print(tse)
```

## Then we plot a basic abundance plot:
```{r}
p_class_basic <- plotAbundance(tse, assay.type="counts", group = "class")
print(p_class_basic)
```
The basic plot, while informative, is challenging to interpret due to:
- Overlapping labels and cluttered x-axis
- All samples grouped together without clear visual distinction
- Difficulty in comparing treatment effects


## Improvements:
Since this plot seems rather difficult to interpret, we will change a few parameters to hopefully make it more readable:
```{r}
p_class <- plotAbundance(tse, assay.type="counts", group = "class", 
                         color_by = "Environment") +
  facet_wrap(~Genotype) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold")) +
  labs(title = "Bacterial Abundance at Class Level",
       x = "Class",
       y = "Abundance",
       fill = "Environment")
print(p_class)
```

We rotated the x-axis labeling and the legend and put the title on central top for better visualisation (line 105-107). Further we labeled the axis with appropriate names (line 108-109). Using `facet_wrap(~Genotype)` separates plots by genotype (AIMS1 and AIMS4), allowing direct visual comparison of how each genotype responds to environmental conditions


If needed, one can save this improved plot in a seperate folder for better organization:
```{r}
if (!dir.exists("figures")) {
  dir.create("figures")
}

ggsave("figures/class_level_abundance.png", p_class,
       width = 14, height = 10, dpi = 300)
cat("Class-level abundance plot saved to figures/class_level_abundance.png\n")
```
## Interpretation:

- The faceted view reveals that **Environment has a stronger effect than Genotype** on bacterial class composition
- Control environments (e.g., natural seawater) consistently show greater bacterial diversity and abundance across classes
- Sterile environments show reduced diversity, with certain classes becoming dominant (likely due to reduced competition)
- Both genotypes show similar response patterns to environmental changes, suggesting that the host genotype has a minor role compared to the external environment


# Statistics
## Alpha diversity
For further statistical analysis, we need to add alpha diversity values. First, we add the alpha diversity values and display them:
```{r add_alpha_diversity}
index <- c("coverage", "inverse_simpson", "gini", "shannon_diversity")
tse <- addAlpha(tse, index = index)

cat("Alpha diversity indices added to the object:\n")
print(colnames(colData(tse)))
```
Secondly, we extract column data and create a data frame for easier handling. To verify, we display the column headers:
```{r}
col_dat <- as.data.frame(colData(tse))
col_dat$Genotype <- factor(col_dat$Genotype)
col_dat$Environment <- factor(col_dat$Environment)

diversity_data <- as.data.frame(col_dat)

cat("Diversity data structure:\n")
available_cols <- intersect(c("ID", "Genotype", "Environment", 
                              "shannon_diversity", "coverage",
                              "inverse_simpson", "gini"),
                           colnames(diversity_data))
print(head(diversity_data[, available_cols]))

# Summary statistics
cat("\n\nSummary statistics for diversity measures:\n")
print(summary(diversity_data[, available_cols[-1: -6]]))
```

Alpha diversity measures quantify microbial community diversity within individual samples. Different indices emphasize different aspects:

- **Shannon Diversity:** Incorporates richness and evenness; standard ecological metric
- **Coverage (Goods Estimator):** Estimates proportion of total diversity captured; considers all taxa equally
- **Inverse Simpson:** Emphasizes dominant taxa; less sensitive to rare species
- **Gini Coefficient:** Measures inequality in abundance distribution; high values indicate unequal distribution

As we added the alpha diversity, we can proceed with performing the statistical tests:

## Statistical Testing
### Genotype significance
First, we want to have a look at the genotype:
```{r}
p_shannon_genotype <- plotColData(tse, "shannon_diversity", "Genotype",
                                   colour_by = "Environment", show_median = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Genotype", 
       title = "Shannon Diversity by Genotype")

plot(shannon_diversity ~ Genotype, col_dat)
#If needed, we can save it:
#ggsave("figures/Shannon_div_Genty.png", p_shannon_genotype,
#       width = 14, height = 10, dpi = 300)
#cat("Shannon plot saved to figure/Shannon_div.png\n")

print(p_shannon_genotype)
```

We also compute the Student's t-test:

```{r}
t.test(shannon_diversity ~ Genotype, col_dat)
```

For the means of this course, we tried to deepen the analysis a bit:

```{r}
# Student's t-test for genotype
diversity_measures <- c("shannon_diversity", "faith_diversity", "coverage", 
                        "inverse_simpson", "gini")
ttest_genotype_shannon <- t.test(shannon_diversity ~ Genotype, col_dat)
print(ttest_genotype_shannon)

# Store results
gen_results <- list()
gen_pvalues <- numeric(length(diversity_measures))
gen_means <- data.frame(measure = character(), AIMS1 = numeric(), 
                        AIMS4 = numeric(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

names(gen_pvalues) <- diversity_measures


cat("\nEffect size:\n")
aims1_mean <- mean(col_dat[col_dat$Genotype == "AIMS1", "shannon_diversity"], na.rm = TRUE)
aims4_mean <- mean(col_dat[col_dat$Genotype == "AIMS4", "shannon_diversity"], na.rm = TRUE)
cat("AIMS1 mean Shannon diversity:", round(aims1_mean, 3), "\n")
cat("AIMS4 mean Shannon diversity:", round(aims4_mean, 3), "\n")
cat("Difference:", round(abs(aims1_mean - aims4_mean), 3), "\n")
```


## Environmental significance

After comparing the genotype, we also want to have a look at the environment:
```{r}
p_shannon_environment <- plotColData(tse, "shannon_diversity", "Environment",
                                      colour_by = "Genotype", show_median = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Environment", 
       title = "Shannon Diversity by Environment")

plot(shannon_diversity ~ Environment, col_dat)
#If needed, we can save it:
#ggsave("figures/Shannon_div_Env.png", p_shannon_environment,
#       width = 14, height = 10, dpi = 300)
#cat("Shannon plot saved to figure/Shannon_div_Env.png\n")

print(p_shannon_environment)
```

```{r}
# Student's t-test for genotype
ttest_environment_shannon <- t.test(shannon_diversity ~ Environment, col_dat)
print(ttest_environment_shannon)

# Store results
env_results <- list()
env_pvalues <- numeric(length(diversity_measures))
env_means <- data.frame(measure = character(), Control = numeric(), 
                        Sterile = numeric(), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

names(env_pvalues) <- diversity_measures

cat("\nEffect size:\n")
aims1_mean <- mean(col_dat[col_dat$Genotype == "AIMS1", "shannon_diversity"], na.rm = TRUE)
aims4_mean <- mean(col_dat[col_dat$Genotype == "AIMS4", "shannon_diversity"], na.rm = TRUE)
cat("AIMS1 mean Shannon diversity:", round(aims1_mean, 3), "\n")
cat("AIMS4 mean Shannon diversity:", round(aims4_mean, 3), "\n")
cat("Difference:", round(abs(aims1_mean - aims4_mean), 3), "\n")
```

For a better overview, we created a table:

```{r}
# Create comprehensive summary table
diversity_measures <- c("shannon_diversity", "faith_diversity", "coverage", 
                        "inverse_simpson", "gini")
p_value_summary <- data.frame(
  Diversity_Measure = diversity_measures,
  Environment_p = round(env_pvalues, 5),
  Env_Significant = ifelse(env_pvalues < 0.05, "Yes ***", "No"),
  Genotype_p = round(gen_pvalues, 5),
  Gen_Significant = ifelse(gen_pvalues < 0.05, "Yes ***", "No")
)

cat("\n========================================\n")
cat("SUMMARY TABLE: P-VALUE RESULTS (α = 0.05)\n")
cat("========================================\n\n")
print(knitr::kable(p_value_summary,
                   caption = "Summary of T-test Results: P-values for Environment and Genotype Effects"))
```

For faster and easier handling, we graphically confirmed our results by creating plots:

```{r}
p_shannon <- plotColData(tse, "shannon_diversity", "Genotype",
                          colour_by = "Environment", show_median = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Genotype")
p_shannon

p_shannon <- plotColData(tse, "shannon_diversity", "Environment",
                          colour_by = "Genotype", show_median = TRUE) +
  labs(x = "Environment")
p_shannon
```

# Discussion
## Environment Effect Results:

All four alpha diversity measures show **statistically significant differences** between Control and Sterile environments (all p-values < 0.05):

- **Shannon Diversity (p ≈ 4.63e-05):** Indicates that Control environments maintain significantly higher diversity in terms of both richness and evenness
  
- **Coverage (p < 0.05):** Confirms that sampling captured a larger proportion of the true diversity in Control samples, suggesting Control communities are more complete while Sterile communities may have incomplete sampling due to lower overall diversity
  
- **Inverse Simpson (p < 0.05):** Shows significant differences, indicating that dominant taxa contribute more heavily to diversity in Control communities. The sterile environment may select for specific dominant bacterial classes
  
- **Gini Coefficient (p < 0.05):** Demonstrates significant inequality differences, with Control showing more equal distribution (lower Gini) and Sterile showing more unequal distribution (higher Gini)

**Comparison to Shannon Diversity:**

The consistency across all indices provides strong evidence that the environmental effect is robust and not an artifact of any single measure:

| Aspect | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Richness** | All indices show Control > Sterile (more species/taxa present) |
| **Evenness** | Control communities are more balanced; Sterile shows dominance by few taxa |
| **Dominance** | Inverse Simpson highest in Control (less dominated by single species) |
| **Overall Pattern** | Convergent evidence: Environment is the dominant driver |

## Genotype Effect Results:

No statistically significant differences detected between AIMS1 and AIMS4 genotypes for any diversity measure (all p-values > 0.05). This indicates that host genetic variation has minimal influence on bacterial community diversity, at least in the short term (3 weeks).

**Biological Interpretation:**

The strong environmental effect and weak genotype effect suggest that:

1. **Environmental plasticity dominates:** Short-term exposure to sterile seawater dramatically reduces bacterial diversity, regardless of host genotype
2. **Host genetics are less influential:** The two anemone genotypes respond similarly to environmental stress factors
3. **Ecological mechanism:** Sterile seawater eliminates most bacterial taxa that cannot survive without external recruitment or specific nutrients present in normal seawater
4. **Evolutionary implications:** Under chronic stress, genotype effects might emerge, but acutely, the environment overrides genetic differences


# Part Two: Protein Folding prediction
The FAP results from the BLAST search origin from the automated BLAST search code from Task_1, which will not be displayed here again.
The sequences from the original publication were retrieved from TUGraz TeachCenter/Course/LabouratoryCourseBioinformatics/Fatty_acid_photodecarboxylase.
In the following section, we will extract one sequence from each FASTA-file and predict a protein structure using AlphaFold. Further, we want to analyze it graphically using PyMol.

## Sequence retrival from publication and BLAST search:
First, we extract two sequences (one from each file) and save them as a single sequence FASTA file:

```{r}
lines <- readLines("FAP_BLAST.fas")

h_idx <- which(substr(lines, 1, 1) == ">")[1]
h_idx_2 <- which(substr(lines, 1, 1) == ">")[2]
if (is.na(h_idx_2)) {
  h_idx_2 <- length(lines) + 1
}

#Extract the sequence and the name
seq <- paste(lines[(h_idx + 1):(h_idx_2 - 1)], collapse = "")
name <- sub(">", "", lines[h_idx])

fasta_content <- paste0(">", name, "\n", seq, "\n")

# Save to file
writeLines(fasta_content, "01sequence_input.fasta")

cat("✓ FASTA file created: 01sequence_input.fasta\n")

#Show the content
cat("File content (first 300 characters):\n")
cat(substr(fasta_content, 1, 300), "\n")
if (nchar(fasta_content) > 300) {
  cat("... [", nchar(seq), " bp total]\n")
}

```

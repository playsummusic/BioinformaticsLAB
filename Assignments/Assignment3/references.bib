    abstract = {Queuosine (Q) is a conserved hypermodification of the wobble base of tRNA containing GUN anticodons but the physiological consequences of Q deficiency are poorly understood in bacteria. This work combines transcriptomic, proteomic and physiological studies to characterize a Q-deficient Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 mutant. The absence of Q led to an increased resistance to nickel and cobalt, and to an increased sensitivity to cadmium, compared to the wild-type (WT) strain. Transcriptomic analysis of the WT and Q-deficient strains, grown in the presence and absence of nickel, revealed that the nickel transporter genes (nikABCDE) are downregulated in the Q– mutant, even when nickel is not added. This mutant is therefore primed to resist to high nickel levels. Downstream analysis of the transcriptomic data suggested that the absence of Q triggers an atypical oxidative stress response, confirmed by the detection of slightly elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the mutant, increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat, and a subtle growth phenotype in a strain prone to accumulation of ROS.},
